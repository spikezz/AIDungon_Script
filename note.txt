"I have no plans for today, want to grab a coffee? You can tell me how you've been." she says while smiling.
"Sure." You nod.

 You quickly reply without thinking.

"I am getting really scared..." Someone said, "I have to get off at the next stop!"

everthing will be fine.
You try to reassure yourself. But you can see the panic in people's eyes.

 He wears a head-mounted camera. 

"What do you want?" You shouted.


 He wears a black t-shirt and shorts,He looks quite young, 16 or 17 at the oldest. There is something odd with him.

The boy let out a small laugh,

He looks at you with interest. He is about your age, 

Wait a moment! The phone... Why 

 Cruel and merciless.

For all you know, the brakes could lock up and cause the train to crash at full speed.
For all you know, nothing will happen and the train will keep on going. 

"You fucking pussy." He spits out. 

"You chose the moral high ground. How do you feel, knowing that ?"

You stagger over to him, pulling him up by the collar. He laughs in your face.

The train stops just as it reaches the curved section. The emergency brake has prevented the train from falling off the bridge...

"Then, it was nice knowing you all." 

You close your eyes, and pull down the handle above the door. The red and silver bar drops down, and makes a loud squeaking sound.


The train enters the bridge, as it starts to pick up even more speed. The boy looks at you with a menacing stare. His deep black eyes pierce through your very being.But you can also see something different in his eyes. You can see excitement and joy.
"We're all dead." He says in a monotone voice, as he picks up his bag.
His eyes are now full of fear and excitement. "I hope you all rest in peace." He says.

"Body is a heavy burden." The boy repeats what you said to him earlier.

The boy seems irritated by the girl's interruption.

He is tall, slim and skinny. He has brown hair, pale skin and brown eyes. Likewise, he is younger than you by at least 6 or more years.

You chuckle. "No offense, but the German government is not going to waste their time protecting a middle eastern minister."
Barrett got mad. "I am not middle eastern and neither is he."

Your earpiece crackles.
"I think I saw something."

'This is how I'm going to die, in a throng of people trampling each other to death during New Year's countdown...'
A thought crosses your mind.

What used to be a brightly colored sculpture in the middle of the square is now just a twisted piece of metal, fire still flashing inside of it.


" Shut up!"A vein pops in your forehead.
Suddenly, a large wall of people go down from the opposite direction and drown you.

"I would bet 20 bucks that he'll fall over himself in 30..." Before he could finish his sentence, a loud bang interrupted him.

"Bye, see you later, Wolfie." You give your husband another kiss before he leaves.

While you are stepping forward to enter the square, a hand pulls your sleeve.
"Officer."
You turn around to see a policeman with a blackened and bleeding face, he seems very tired.

You find a hand sticking out of the wreckage, you try to dig it out. It is Anastasios's hand... The rest of his body is nowhere to be seen.

You find a corpse at the wreckage of a building, you look closely and recognize Anastasios. He is hit by a piece of iron and covered with bleeding, he can't be saved.
You see another one from afar, it is Barrett.
He is lying awkwardly and not moving. You go over to him and call his name out load, he doesn't reply.

You try to , although it is not helping.

"Shut up!" You rage at him and start to push the wood with all your strength.


 You look at his face, he looks so peaceful now.

you burst into tears.

you feel utterly hopeless.

Antonio 

"Yes." You said.
"I need to ask you something," He said, sitting down next to you, "what happened yesterday?"

bowing his head slightly. "I'm detective Marco."
"It's really sad." You whisper, still staring at your husband. Marco does not say anything and you hear a sigh escape his lips.
